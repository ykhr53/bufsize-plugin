# bufsize
## Name
*bufsize* - modifying EDNS0 buffer size for the flag day and protecting by vulnerability of IP flagmentation.

## Description
In the next DNS Flag Day, message size should be considered to avoid IP fragmentation.  

https://dnsflagday.net/2020/  
> Until such a standard exists, we recommend that the EDNS buffer size should, by default, be set to a value small enough to avoid fragmentation on the majority of network links in use today.

## Syntax
```text
bufsize [SIZE]
```

**[SIZE]** is an int value for setting the buffer size.  
The default value is 512, and the value must be within 512 - 4096.  
Only one argument is acceptable.

## Examples
```text
example.org {
    bufsize 1232
}
```

## Considerations
For now, if a client does not use EDNS, this plugin would not add OPT RR.  
But we can change this behavior to add OPT RR, because of the following description on RFC 6891.

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891#section-6.1.1
> The OPT RR MAY be placed anywhere within the additional data section.
